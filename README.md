# Deep Learning
Utilizing PyTorch to build custom and fine-tune pre-trained models for various tasks.


### **1. [Classification | Convolution Network:](https://github.com/ahmadhatahet/deep-learning/blob/master/cnn-model-cifar10.ipynb)**
Train custom convolution network model to classify Cifar-10 image dataset.<br />
The model achieved  ~91% accuracy and ~0.22% loss.

### **2. [Exploring | Learning Rate Schedulers:](https://github.com/ahmadhatahet/deep-learning/blob/master/learning-schedulers.ipynb)**
Plot the behavior of different known learning rate schedulers to use in training models.
